Solid Performance is a no-code solution for increasing the page performance of your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Site speed and performance optimization don‚Äôt have to be a complex task. With Solid Performance, simply install and activate, and the plugin will incrementally create static versions of each URL of your website for an instant performance boost. 

= How Solid Performance Increases Your Site Performance and Page Speed ‚úÖ = 

You‚Äôre busy, and you need to spend time building your website. In order to build well you need a solid foundation. Installing Solid Performance lets you optimize your site performance right away and start building sooner and faster without having to spend time configuring dozens of options. 

A solid caching solution should not cause breakage with your favorite plugins. Solid Performance comes out of the box with smart plugin exception rules for pages that have dynamic content created by these plugins:
* WooCommerce
* GiveWP

With these smart defaults and page caching in place automatically, you can focus your time and energy on building and enhancing your website instead of struggling through dozens of caching settings. 

= What is Caching and how does Solid Speed leverage it ‚ùì = 

There are several different types of caching

Solid Performance focuses exclusively on page caching, grabbing the HTML of your WordPress URLs and storing that in a secure directory. Then, when your visitors arrive at your site, the browser doesn‚Äôt need to run through PHP or hit your database again, it just serves up the static HTML, CSS, and JS files fast and simply.  

= How Page Caching Benefits Your Website Performance üöÄ =

As soon as you activate Solid Performance, your site will get an immediate boost. You‚Äôll see benefits like these:
üöÄ Improved site performance (content delivery speed) 
üöÄ Reduced drag on server load
üöÄ Measurable, quantifiable stats: lower bounce rates and higher conversion rates

When a site developer or manager is able to improve site performance for a client (for example), they are able to provide improved SEO results and meet a widely accepted expectation that well-run sites do not have slow download or content delivery times. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this help me pass all Core Web Vitals? =

Core Web Vitals is impacted mostly by your theme and the creative assets and scripts you use to build your website. But page caching (the kind Solid Performance leverages) helps specifically to improve your time to ‚ÄúLargest Contentful Paint‚Äù, which is one important Web Core Vital metric. 

= How does Solid Performance improve the performance of my website?  =

When Solid Performance is activated on a site, a specific advanced cache drop-in file will be added to the wp-content directory.

Using a drop-in will allow the plugin to handle serving cached responses to users before WordPress has had a chance to load fully since they load prior to MU and normal plugins.

When page caching is enabled, the buffer generated by WordPress will be saved to a static HTML file within the wp-content/cache directory. On subsequent requests to the same post, Solid Performance will respond with the cached page.

= Is Solid Performance compatible with popular plugins like WooCommerce and GiveWP? 

Solid Performance will detect active plugins that have known cache exclusions, like WooCommerce & GiveWP (and more!), and implement them automatically.

== Installation ==

There are several ways to install and activate Solid Performance for your website. Here are two of them:

= Install Solid Performance via the ‚ÄúAdd Plugins‚Äù screen = 

To install and activate Solid Performance via your WordPress admin area, navigate to ‚ÄúPlugins > Add New Plugin‚Äù. On that screen, go to the search field on the far right top of the screen and type in ‚ÄúSolid Performance‚Äù and hit Enter. The ‚ÄúSolid Performance‚Äù plugin should be your first result. 

In the ‚ÄúSolid Performance‚Äù plugin card, click on the ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù button. You‚Äôll see the button change to ‚ÄúInstalling‚Äù, then it will switch to say ‚ÄúActivate‚Äù, click ‚ÄúActivate‚Äù. At that point, Solid Performance is active on your website. 

Lastly, navigate to the Dashboard, then navigate to ‚ÄúSettings > Solid Performance‚Äù and toggle the option to ‚ÄúEnable Page Cache‚Äù. Now your site is SOLID with Solid Performance. 

= Install Solid Performance via SFTP = 

1. Navigate to wordpress.org/plugins/solid-performance and near the top right of the screen, click on ‚ÄúDownload.‚Äù That will download the solid-performance.zip file. 
2. Unzip the file locally on your computer. That should give you a folder called ‚Äúsolid-performance‚Äù with all the plugin files. If there is a sub-folder in that folder also called ‚Äúsolid-performance‚Äù then we‚Äôll use the sub-folder. 
3. Upload the whole ‚Äúsolid-performance‚Äù sub-folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Navigate to your WordPress admin area, and then to ‚ÄúPlugins‚Äù. You‚Äôll see ‚ÄúSolid Performance‚Äù in your list of plugins, but it will not be activated. Click on the ‚ÄúActivate‚Äù link.
5. The page will refresh automatically. Navigate to ‚ÄúSettings > Solid Performance‚Äù. 
6. Toggle the ‚ÄúEnable Page Caching‚Äù option. 

Now your site is SOLID with Solid Performance!
